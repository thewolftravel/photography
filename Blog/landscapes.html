Portraits
January 1, 2024
Imagine standing on the edge of a wide, sandy beach, the salty breeze gently caressing your skin. Or picture yourself trekking up a rugged hill, your heart pounding with anticipation as you reach the summit. These were the landscapes that shaped my childhood, the scenes that filled my days as I grew up in the beautiful town of Balneario Camboriu in Brazil.

Brazil, with its vibrant culture and breathtaking landscapes, is a world of its own. It is a country where nature effortlessly dazzles and captivates all who are lucky enough to witness its wonders. As a child, I found my solace and joy in the embrace of its golden beaches and lush forests. The crashing waves of the Atlantic Ocean became my playground, and the hills near the coast became my sanctuary.



But as life often does, it took an unexpected turn, and I found myself halfway across the globe, in a land of majestic mountains and vast plains. Colorado, USA, welcomed me with its open arms, and I soon discovered that nature had other ways of enchanting my senses.

In this vast expanse of wilderness, I found a different kind of beauty. The towering peaks of the Rocky Mountains stood proudly against the sky, their jagged edges painting an awe-inspiring silhouette. The golden plains stretched as far as the eye could see, whispering tales of adventure and serenity. Colorado's landscapes, though different from the beaches of my childhood, held their own kind of magic. They beckoned me to explore, to capture their essence through the lens of my camera.



As a photographer, I have come to understand that nature is not merely a backdrop for my art; it is the very essence of it. Every click of the shutter is an attempt to freeze a moment, to immortalize the beauty that surrounds us. In the vast landscapes of Brazil and Colorado alike, each photograph captures a story, a connection formed between the viewer and the natural world.

Nature has always been my home, my refuge from the chaos and noise of everyday life. There is something sublime in the way it simultaneously humbles and empowers us. It reminds us that we are but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of existence, yet it fuels our souls and fills us with a sense of purpose.

But let us not forget that nature can also be a dangerous mistress. Those awe-inspiring mountains can quickly turn treacherous, their beauty concealing the risks that lie beneath their surface. The same waves that carry surfers with unwavering grace can also swallow them whole. As photographers, we must navigate this delicate dance between capturing the beauty and respecting the sheer power of nature.




In my journey as a photographer, I have learned that the key lies in understanding and connection. It is in those moments of connection that the photograph truly comes alive, transcending mere pixels on a screen. As I frame a landscape or focus on a single detail, I strive to find that connection, that spark of life that will resonate with the viewer.

So, whether it's the gentle lapping of waves against a distant shore or the sight of a golden eagle soaring through the open sky, let us all embrace the call of the wild. Let us discover the miracles that nature has to offer and connect with the world around us. And in doing so, let us deepen our appreciation for the beauty that surrounds us, in all its dangerous and stunning glory.
