Keystone | Documentary Photography
December 2, 2023
Winter in Colorado is truly something magical. The way the snow glistens as it blankets the mountains, the crisp chill in the air, and the adrenaline-fueled excitement of hitting the slopes - it's a season that holds so much beauty and thrill. As someone who recently moved to Colorado, I have found myself drawn to the world of snow sports, particularly snowboarding. There's something incredibly liberating about gliding down the mountain, carving fresh tracks in the powder.

In my short time as a new snowboarder, my passion for this exhilarating sport has only grown stronger. I've come to discover Keystone Resort, which I now proudly call my home mountain. It's here that I've not only found a community of like-minded people who share my love for snowboarding, but it's also where I've found inspiration for my photography.

You see, as much as I adore the feeling of snowboarding down those slopes, I am equally captivated by the individuals who dare to conquer this seemingly treacherous terrain. I've been fortunate enough to witness firsthand their unwavering determination to learn something new, something that can be quite dangerous at times. It's through their sheer passion and resilience that I've found my own sense of connection and purpose.

Recently, I came up with an idea to give back to this amazing community that has welcomed me with open arms. I decided to host free events at Keystone Resort, where I offer to take candid and action shots of people skiing and snowboarding. I want to document their passion for the sport and showcase their bravery.

Through these events, I've had the privilege of capturing truly authentic moments. The joy and exhilaration etched across their faces as they glide effortlessly through the snow. The determination that fuels them to keep pushing their limits, even when faced with falls and failures. It's these moments that I strive to capture through my lens - snapshots of pure passion, resilience, and the indomitable human spirit

As I look back on my personal journey and growth as both a photographer and snowboarder, I can't help but feel immensely grateful. Not only have I found a new medium to express my creativity, but I've also discovered a deep sense of fulfillment in showcasing the beauty of this incredible sport and the incredible individuals who partake in it.

In a world that often feels divided, snow sports have a unique power to bring people together. It's a shared love for the slopes, a mutual understanding of the challenges and joys that come with conquering them. And through my photography, I hope to capture and immortalize these connections, these fleeting moments of unity and passion.

So, if you happen to find yourself at Keystone Resort, keep an eye out for me. I'll be the one with the camera, eagerly freezing these captivating moments in time. And perhaps, through my lens, you'll catch a glimpse of the extraordinary beauty and determination that exists within each and every snow sports enthusiast.
