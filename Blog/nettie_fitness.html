November 6, 2018
I recently had the opportunity to work with someone incredible named Nettie. Nettie is not only a personal trainer but also a bodybuilder competitor. She approached me for a photoshoot, and I must say, it was an amazing experience.

During our shoot, we had a fantastic workout and stretching session. Nettie's expertise and passion for fitness really shone through. She has a remarkable ability to help people achieve their fitness goals.

As a photographer, my role was to capture candid shots and posed photos for Nettie's competition and brand. Candid shots are those spontaneous moments that truly capture the essence of a person. These photos show Nettie in her natural element, showcasing her strength and determination.

On the other hand, posed photos are more staged and deliberate. They allow Nettie to showcase her hard-earned physique and highlight specific muscle groups. These photos are essential for Nettie's competition and branding purposes, as they demonstrate the dedication and hard work she puts into her training.

Working with Nettie was a joy. Her energy and enthusiasm for fitness were contagious, and it inspired me to capture the essence of her journey through my photographs. I believe our collaboration resulted in stunning images that truly represent Nettie's incredible fitness journey.

So, whether you're searching for a personal trainer or looking for fitness inspiration, Nettie is your go-to person. Her determination, expertise, and passion for fitness will undoubtedly help you achieve your goals. And if you ever need someone to capture your journey through authentic and posed photographs, I'm here to help you just like I did for Nettie.
